# ScrollFlagsPlayground

This projects helps to visualize the effects of AppBarLayout\`s scroll flags.
The app consists of 2 screens: the 1st screen allows to choose scroll flags and CollapsingToolbarLayout\`s collapse_mode. While the 2nd screen receives those flags as input and behaves accordingly.
